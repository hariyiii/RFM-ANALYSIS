Built an interactive dashboard to explore Customer Segmentation & RFM Analysisâ€”using drill-throughs, slicers, and filters for a smooth user experience.

ğŸ”¹ Ran RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to understand customer behavior
ğŸ”¹ Segmented users into VIP, loyal, at-risk, etc.
ğŸ”¹ Calculated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
ğŸ”¹ Analyzed customer distribution by region and country
ğŸ”¹ Visualized everything in a clean, interactive dashboard to support strategic decisions

This project helped me sharpen my skills in data storytelling and made complex insights easy to digest.
